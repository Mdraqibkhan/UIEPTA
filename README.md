## Folder Structure
The `uw_data` directory consists of two main subdirectories: `train`, which contains subdirectories `a` (housing training input images) and `b` (containing corresponding ground truth images for training), and `test`, which contains subdirectories `a` (with testing input images) and `b` (containing corresponding ground truth images for testing).
